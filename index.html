	<h1>INTERVIEW WITH <BR>
	THE AUTHOR ✰</h1>

	<br>

	<h2>Interests outside of school?</h2>
	<p>I'm really interested in yoga and try to do yoga practices at least a few times a week. I love reading and writing and am the blog editor for 12th Street which is one of the New School's literary magazines. I also love walking around the city and exploring new areas of New York. I also love Harry Styles, Twitter, reality TV, cooking, goldfish (the food not the animal lol), my dog, and my weighted blanket.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>What's the biggest risk you've ever taken?</h2>
	<p>I decided to drop out of Miami of Ohio in December 2018 because I was really unhappy and I moved back to London. I ended up working for a fashion magazine part time and selling wedding dresses/doing personal styling part time! I was nervous about taking time off but it allowed me to explore my passions and meet so many incredible people.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>What are three words/phrases that you'd use to describe yourself?</h2>
	<p>Mine would probably be: Enthusiastic, emotional (lol), and easily entertained</p>

	<br>

	<h2>What factors lead you to come to The New School?</h2>
	<p>As I mentioned, I had dropped out of Miami of Ohio and taken a semester off. I knew I wanted to go back to school and I knew I wanted a school with rigorous writing program in a big city. So, the New School ticked off these boxes! I've also always wanted to live in New York, so I figured that now was the perfect time. </p>

	<br>

	<h2>What did it feel like when you received your Acceptance Letter to The New School?</h2>
	<p>I was really excited when I received my acceptance letter! And even more excited when I got my acceptance letter into the Riggio Honors program because I'd heard that the professors were incredible. I didn't have my heart set on the New School yet and was immediately concerned about the cost of the school and the cost of living in New York. Eventually, though, I decided that TNS was the perfect fit for me and I definitely made the right decision.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>What was it like leading up to the months before you started classes at The New School? Were there any challenges? Did you have to move?</h2>
	<p>I did have to move. I moved to New York from London only a couple days before classes started, so I was still jetlagged during my first week. I was nervous to be moving to New York because I didn't know many people, but luckily my best friend from Miami of Ohio had transferred to NYU so we moved in together which has been a lifesaver. As soon as classes started, I was enthralled. I've always loved learning and had missed school while on my gap semester. I especially loved being able to take classes that fit my major, as I had fortunately finished all my pre-reqs in Ohio.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>What was your orientation experience like? What were some of your biggest questions?</h2>
	<p>I actually didn't have orientation. Since I am in BPATS, some of the students are older and work full time, so it's almost impossible to do things during the day. Also, since I'm a transfer student in BPATS (not in Lang or Parsons), I never got emails or correspondence about transfer orientation, which means that I never had the chance to meet transfer students my own age. This is also part of the reason I wanted to become an OL-- to help over BPATS transfer students easily acclimate.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>How was your first semester as a New School student? What challenges did you face? What were your favorite moments/highlights?</h2>
	<p>My first semester went really well. I loved all my classes and could feel myself growing as a student and a person. I'd say that my biggest challenge was trying to meet people. I'm shy at first so it's hard to put myself out there, but I really had to step up and attend events to make friends, even when it was uncomfortable. I live in SoHo when I'm in New York so that's probably my highlight. I love being surrounded by great food, great bookstores, and great shops. I also love the writing program/community at TNS. I feel like I know everyone in my program and they're all so supportive and encouraging. </p>
